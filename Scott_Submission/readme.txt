Code used:
        http://www.d3noob.org/2013/01/adding-title-to-your-d3js-graph.html
        Had instructions on how to create chart titles. Required some fiddling to figure out how to get the titles for the second set of charts.

        https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245
        Code for how to generate a line chart. I had a LOT of trouble reading the API reference for D3 and had a sort of fundamental disconnect between how it operated and what was happening on the screen.
        Eventually got there.

I did not work with anyone else on this project. This is the first time I've looked at javascript in years, and I've never been proficient at it. It was a more challenging assignment than anticipated.
